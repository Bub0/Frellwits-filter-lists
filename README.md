# Frellwit's filter lists
Various filter lists for your adblock extension.

**YouTube-Clickbait-Destroyer.txt** = A concept filter that filters out some common clickbait titles from your recommendations. Requires uBlock Origin 1.8.4 or later.

**Youtube-Junk-Channels.txt** = A cosmetic filter list for uBlock Origin that aims to get rid of YouTube channels that use clickbait nsfw thumbnails or titles. Can also be extended to get rid of accounts that are just spam. Please report an issue if there are any channels you that you think should be added.

**deviantJUNKfilter.txt** = A filter for deviantart.com. Blocks over 1000 of users that upload junk or stuff in the wrong categories. (Warning: This list is highly personal and may not suit everyone.)
