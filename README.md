# Frellwit's filter lists
Various filter lists for your adblock extension.

**YouTube-Clickbait-Destroyer.txt** = A concept filter that filters out some common clickbait titles from your recommendations. Requires uBlock Origin 1.8.4 or later.

**Youtube-Junk-Channels.txt** = A cosmetic filter list for uBlock Origin that aims to get rid of YouTube channels that use clickbait nsfw thumbnails or titles. Can also be extended to get rid of accounts that are just spam. Please report an issue if there are any channels that you think should be added. If you want manual control you should consider using any addon that can block YouTube channels.
