**Youtube-Junk-Channels.txt** *Obsolete filter* = A cosmetic filter list for uBlock Origin that aims to get rid of YouTube channels that use clickbait nsfw thumbnails or titles. Can also be extended to get rid of accounts that are just spam. Please report an issue if there are any channels that you think should be added. If you want manual control you should consider using any addon that can block YouTube channels. ([Raw link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lassekongo83/Frellwits-filter-lists/master/YouTube-Junk-Channels.txt))

Note: The 2 YouTube filters are obsolete and will not work properly with YouTube's newer designs.
